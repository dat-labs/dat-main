# dat support

ETL platforms are complex systems with numerous integrations, and customers may sometimes face issues with certain components. dat offers users the following support modes:

* To get help from the community, review current user topics, join or start a discussion, you can use our dat community forum.
* If you are facing issues with bugs, try looking for your issue under [BUGS](https://github.com/dat-labs/dat-main/issues?q=%5BBUG%5D). There is a good chance that someone else from the community encountered the issue and found a solution.
* You can also provide feedback through our dat slack channel.
