This is the place from where you want to move your data.

This marks the beginning of the data migration process. All essential information to be transferred is initially stored here. From this point, the data will undergo the required steps and transformations to ensure its efficient transfer to the target destination.

Focusing on this key location marks the start of the  entire ETL operation. Here, we initiate procedures to ensure precise data capture, comprehensive analysis, and thorough preparation for migration. By doing so, we facilitate a seamless transition, reducing risks and errors while enhancing data integrity and security. Proper data handling at this stage sets the foundation for a dependable, robust, and resilient data migration strategy.

For an ETL pipeline configuration, the source refers to the Webpage, Database, or File from which data is moved. For example, if transferring data from AWS S3 to a Pinecone Vector database, AWS S3 is the source.
